- output path should be relative to unity project
- maybe format the output really nice in general, so it can easily be used by other programms
- could have some arg like "show guid"
- make multiple inputs seperated by space possible (future: handle names with spaces)
- figure out how to parse args
- could be an arg to have
  - absolute paths in the output
  - the guid in the output
  - the file name only in the output (without the name of the type)

- fix typo, should be dumb, not dump. :facepalm:
